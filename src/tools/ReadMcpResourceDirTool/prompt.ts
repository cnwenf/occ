export const DESCRIPTION = `

`

export const PROMPT = `
List the direct children of a directory resource on an MCP server (\`resources/directory/read\`).
Parameters:
- server (required): The name of the MCP server to read from
- uri (required): The URI of the directory resource
The listing is not recursive. Each entry carries its own \`uri\`; subdirectories appear with mimeType "inode/directory" — call this tool again on a subdirectory's \`uri\` to descend.
Only usable against a server that has declared support for directory listing; other servers return an error.
